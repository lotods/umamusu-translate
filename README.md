This project is a toolset to translate *Uma Musume Pretty Derby* to English. Includes a patch function using these tools.  
It accomplishes this by modifying the master.mdb file and Unity assets, aided additionally with dll hijacking through [TLG].

Translation progress and credits can be checked in [tl-progress]. Guides can be found below.  
For troubleshooting, please open an issue or ask in the [Umamusume Translation Discord][].

This is based on the DMM version of the game and *should* work on linux too.  
Please consider [supporting the project](https://ko-fi.com/noccyu) and its contributors.

# Features
Translates (or *can* translate):
- Character stories
- Main & Event stories
    - Race segments
    - Event prologues
- Training stories
- Home screen lines & interactions (own & lobby characters)
- Lyrics
- Most of the UI through [tlg].
- Skills, names, missions, and other such "dynamic" texts. Same as the older *mdb patch*.
- Planned: images

Deepl/fairseq integration for automatic machine translation.

# Disclaimer

This toolset only changes text to translate it and it is *my belief* this is harmless and unlikely to be an issue. [^1]  
**Nonetheless such edits are of course against cygames/Umamusu TOS so proceed at your own risk!**

[^1]: cygames has a relatively good track record in leaving non-cheating, non-damaging tools and users alone in my experience. Any possible crackdown is also likely to start with announcements and warnings before bans.

# Install 
Make sure you satisfied the *requirements* below first to use the tools. If you don't want to patch, you can [continue here](#advanced-usage).  
Otherwise, follow the further steps for each part of the patch you wish to apply, in suggested order.  
Each of those parts is separate and can be used independently, though some effectiveness may be lost.

## Requirements
1. Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 3.9+
    - *Either* install the py launcher (recommended) *or* select the "add to path" checkbox.
    - If the latest version is very recent use the version *before* that. Otherwise dependencies might not have binaries and may require compiling.
1. Clone or download a zip (green "code" button) of this project
1. Open the (extracted) folder and double click `install.bat` (This downloads the needed python libs)
    - If you choose to install MinGit, it will be used to update automatically where needed, and you can update manually by running `update.bat`.
1. (Optional, for dialogue) Download all game data [through the game menu](guide_batch_download.jpg)
    - The patch will only edit files existing in your game data. If you don't do this you can simply rerun the dialogue import below for new content.

## Config
The first time you run any of the `.bat` files mentioned below, an `umatl.json` file will be created in the folder.  
You can change a few settings there before continuing further if you like, simply run the .bat again.

## UI (menus, buttons, ...)
This should be a one-time procedure. If your UI looks the wrong size afterwards, open the `config.json` you copied and play with the uiScale value (0.8-1.2 usually).
1. Open the game's *install folder* (where the `Umamusume.exe` is)
1. Copy the **contents** of this project's `localify` folder to the *install folder*
1. Download [tlg]'s latest [release zip](https://github.com/MinamiChiwa/Trainers-Legend-G/releases), extract **only the `version.dll`** from it and put that in the game's *install folder*
    - *0xc000012f* error when starting game: [Install vc++ X64](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-US/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170) ([alterative link](https://github.com/abbodi1406/vcredist))
    - If the game *won't start* or the *UI is not translated*, try renaming the `version.dll` file to `uxtheme.dll` (*errors* mean the issue is elsewhere and this will not help)
1. It should look [like this](guide_localify.jpg).

## Skills and other variable text
Change `skill_data` to true in the config if you want to see [the skill's raw requirements and effects](guide_skilldata.png).  
Run the `mdb import.bat` file.
- The mdb file that this modifies updates regularly (with banners usually) and undoes changes, you will need to rerun this .bat.
- Requires restarting the game after applying.
- There is also [a web version](https://noccu.github.io/umamusume-db-translate/) for mobile or other usecases but it it not maintained well anymore.

## Dialogue
Change `skip_mtl` to `true` in the config if you'd like to skip importing Machine Translations.  
Double click `run.bat` 
- This can take a long time (few hours) because there are many files.
- You can close this at any time and resume later, or play the game while this runs.
- Changes apply without restart.

# Updating
1. Double click `update.bat` if you installed MinGit, else pull or download the project again and overwrite
    - Any files you've added yourself through the deepl integration should stay intact, or at worst be overridden with the same (deepl) or better (manual translation) versions. If you've made your own edits to anything though, those would be lost! Please contribute them here so everybody can enjoy!
1. Double click `run.bat` and/or `mdb*.bat` as required.
    - `run.bat` also updates the UI-related files **after** you've followed the UI step above.

# Advanced Usage
In general, check out the [scripts](#script-info). You probably also want to `pip install -r src/devreq.txt`
1. **Dialogue**
    - To install specific things, see [id-structure.md](id-structure.md) and use: `py src/import.py -O -g <group> -id <id>`
    - To add additional translations through deepl, or contribute your own, see [translating.md](translating.md)
2. **UI**
    - To update yourself when the translations are jumbled, see [here](translating.md#updating)
        - Should no longer be needed when using TLG.
3. **Skills and other variable text**: Check the `-h` help for scripts under `src/mdb/`

# Script info

See [data-layout.md](data-layout.md) for an overview of the game's data files and how this repo maps translation files to them.

All scripts are made to be run from the root dir, i.e: `py src/script.py -arg val`  
Arguments can be given to all and it is recommended you do so, processing the smallest amount of files you're comfortable with at a time.  
For detailed info and args, run a script with the `-h` arg. See also [id-structure.md](id-structure.md) for `g`, `id`, and `idx`.

script | desc
---|---
filecopy | Simply copies files from the game dir to the project dir for backup.
restore | Restores original game files from earlier backup or cygames servers.
extract | Reads game files and writes relevant data to a local folder, ready to be translated. Creates *Translation Files*.
import | The reverse; loads *Translation Files* and writes them back to game assets for importing into the game.
machinetl + deepl-translator.user.js | In tandem, provide a way to translate *Translation Files* with deepl or fairseq-compatible trained neural net models. See [details](translating.md#mtl-using-deepl).
names | Translates name fields in *Translation Files* using data from the [db-translate project][].
textprocess | Processes dialogue text in *Translation Files* in various ways. Main use is adjusting lengths of lines for game display.
subtransfer | Imports ASS, SRT or TXT subtitle files into *Translation Files*. A few conventions must be followed, see -h.
edit_story | GUI for editing *Translation Files* by [KevinVG207](https://github.com/KevinVG207).
manage | Small tool to manage localify's data for translating static strings. Requires use of [umamusume-localify][].
common/helpers | Not scripts. Hold shared functions and data for other scripts.
