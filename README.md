This project aims to translate *Uma Musume Pretty Derby* through (mainly) Unity asset edits.  
The intent is to be an all-in-one toolset/patch but right now it is focused on any dialogues with a few extras.  

Translation progress and credits can be checked in [tl-progress]. Guides can be found below.  
For troubleshooting, please open an issue or ask in the [translation discord](https://discord.gg/HpMRFNvsMv).

This is based on the DMM version of the game. If you can figure out how to run it on other versions, it should work with some edits, but no support is provided right now.  
Please consider [supporting the project](https://ko-fi.com/noccyu).

Included translations: [tl-progress]  
Toolset: [scripts](#script-info)

# Disclaimer

This tool collection only changes text to translate it and it is *my belief* this is harmless and unlikely to be an issue. [^1]  
**Nonetheless such edits are of course against cygames/Umamusu TOS so proceed at your own risk!**

[^1]: cygames has a relatively good track record in leaving non-cheating, non-damaging tools and users alone in my experience. any possible crackdown is also likely to start with announcements and warnings before bans.

# Install 
Make sure you satisfied the *requirements* first, then follow the steps in *usage*.

## Requirements
1. Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 3.9+
    - During install, check the `Add to PATH` option.
1. Download this project
1. Open the (extracted) folder and double click `install.bat`
1. (Optional but recommended *for dialogue*) Download all game data [through the game menu](guide_batch_download.jpg)
    - The patch will only edit files existing in your game data. You can simply rerun the import below for new content.

## Basic Usage
1. **UI** (menus, buttons, ...): Open the game's *install folder* (where the `Umamusume.exe` is)
    1. Download [tlg]'s latest [release](https://github.com/MinamiChiwa/Trainers-Legend-G/releases), extract **only the `version.dll`** and put that in the game's *install folder*
    1. Copy the **contents** of this project's `localify` folder to the *install folder*
        - If the game *won't start* and you double checked you did it correctly, try renaming the `version.dll` file to `uxtheme.dll` (*errors* mean the issue is elsewhere)
        - ~~In rare cases when a story overlay pops up in the main menus, your UI may blur and get stuck that way. Temporarily remove the dll and restart the game to do the action. (may only affect uxtheme.dll naming?)~~ (fixed in TLG, I think)
1. **Dialogue**: double click `run.bat` 
1. **Skills and other variable text**: Run either of the `mdb import.bat` files
    - The mdb file that is modified updates often, you will need to redo this step every time it does. Usually when there is an in-game update.
    - Requires restarting the game after applying.
    - For a web version (slightly outdated) see the [db-translate project] and follow its guide for now. It wil be moved to this project soonâ„¢

## Updating
1. Download the project again and overwrite
    - Any files you've added yourself through the deepl integration should stay intact, or at worst be overridden with the same (deepl) or better (manual translation) versions. If you've made your own edits to anything though, those would be lost! You could keep a backup of any edits at the moment you make them, or try picking up git or other version control software. Or best of all, please contribute them so everybody can enjoy them!
1. Double click `run.bat` 

## Advanced Usage
In general, check out the [scripts](#script-info).
1. **Dialogue**
    - To install specific things, see [id-structure.md](id-structure.md) and use: `py src/import.py -O -g <group> -id <id>`
    - To add additional translations through deepl, or contribute your own, see [translating.md](translating.md)
2. **UI**
    - To update yourself when the translations are jumbled, see [here](translating.md#updating)
3. **Skills and other variable text**: See the [db-translate project]

# Script info

See [data-layout.md](data-layout.md) for an overview of the game's data files and how this repo maps translation files to them.

All scripts are made to be run from the root dir, i.e: `py src/script.py -arg val`  
Arguments can be given to all and it is recommended you do so, processing the smallest amount of files you're comfortable with at a time.  
For detailed info and args, run a script with the `-h` arg. See also [id-structure.md](id-structure.md) for `g`, `id`, and `idx`.

script | desc
---|---
filecopy | Simply copies files from the game dir to the project dir for backup.
restore | Restores original game files from earlier backup or cygames servers.
extract | Reads game files and writes relevant data to a local folder, ready to be translated. Creates *Translation Files*.
import | The reverse; loads *Translation Files* and writes them back to game assets for importing into the game.
machinetl + deepl-translator.user.js | In tandem, provide a way to translate *Translation Files* with deepl or fairseq-compatible trained neural net models. See [details](translating.md#mtl-using-deepl).
names | Translates name fields in *Translation Files* using data from the [db-translate project][].
textprocess | Processes dialogue text in *Translation Files* in various ways. Main use is adjusting lengths of lines for game display.
subtransfer | Imports ASS, SRT or TXT subtitle files into *Translation Files*. A few conventions must be followed, see -h.
edit_story | GUI for editing *Translation Files* by [KevinVG207](https://github.com/KevinVG207).
manage | Small tool to manage localify's data for translating static strings. Requires use of [umamusume-localify][].
common/helpers | Not scripts. Hold shared functions and data for other scripts.
