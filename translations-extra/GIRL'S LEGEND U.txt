(Wow wow wow wow）
(Wow wow wow wow）
Here we are together at last

Don't stop! No, don't stop 'til finish! (Wo oh oh)
Don't stop! No, don't stop 'til finish! (Wo oh oh)

Takataktak · Wanna run as hard as I can
On the grass, on the sand, to your pre-race training menu
Turn up! (Turn up!) Raise your voice, shout out loud (wo oh oh)
Tracen! Fight! (Ooh) Fight! (Ooh!)

Takataktak · Wanna beat my time as hard as I can
On my way to a dream I won't yield (wow wow)
Start it right here, my own greatest story (Wow wow wow)
(O-oh-o-oh おっおっおー! O-oh-o-oh おっおっおー!)

To the place that I long for (Borrowing my courage just a bit)
One precious shared memory (The right now we won't see back again)
Oh, these bump-a-bumps and them thump-a-thumps
No I can't contain, can't get enough
These strong tinglings just don't wanna stop

With you I · run to the finish striving all the way
Far and wide they will hear this music
Forever ever ever ever in my thoughts
If my dream will be within reach soon
I'll believe in what I felt that day  The special thing you held in you
Crossing springtimes 'n summers 'n autumns 'n winters   Darting towards the wish I call my dream
To · victory

Don't stop! No, don't stop 'til finish! (Wo oh oh)
Don't stop! No, don't stop 'til finish! (Wo oh oh)

Takataktak · Wanna spurt as hard as I can
Meeting  Expecting  Deciding  They connect who I am
Hands up! (Hands up!) Shout as loud as you can (wo oh oh)
Tracen! Fight! (Ooh) Fight! (Ooh!)

Takataktak · Wanna laugh as hard as I can
Right in the middle of this turf (wow wow)
Start it for real, my own rising story (Wow wow wow)
(O-oh-o-oh おっおっおー! O-oh-o-oh おっおっおー!)

These days that I dashed through (Today's better than yesterday)
Our precious shared glory (The reason why I can become strong)
Now I wanna say I'm "Living at my top"
The cheers pushing me on are heating up
This dream's my dream I won't let it end a fantasy

With you I · build a future starting at the finish line
Aspiring, pursuing, seizing, winning
Forever ever ever ever in my thoughts  My dream's only a few steps away
Believing in what you shed that day  The stream of tears which ran from you
Crossing rainstorms 'n galewinds 'n grey clouds 'n darkness  Darting towards the wish I call my dream
To · victory

In my heart my resolve is unshakable
One by one our achievements are strung together
Shake off the doubts I have looming over me
All I have to do is surpass my own self
Wanna win, wanna win, wanna win · I wanna win with you

With a dream I run to the finish line
Aspiring, pursuing, seizing, winning
Forever ever ever ever in my thoughts  My dream's only a few steps away
Believing in what you shed that day  The stream of tears which ran from you
Crossing springtimes 'n summers 'n autumns 'n winters
rainstorms 'n galewinds 'n grey clouds 'n darkness
To victory
